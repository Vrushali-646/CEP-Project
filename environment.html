    <h1>Environmental Impact on Human Health</h1>
    <p>
      The environment is the foundation of human survival. However, increasing industrialization,
      deforestation, and pollution have severely affected air, water, and soil quality. These environmental
      changes are directly linked to physical and mental health issues, calling for immediate
      action and awareness among individuals and organizations alike.

        <h2>3. Environmental Laws & Penalties</h2>
        <p>
          India has several laws under the <b>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</b> and
          <b>Air and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Acts</b> that strictly prohibit
          industrial or individual pollution. Some of the penalties include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fine up to ₹1,00,000 per day for continued violation.</li>
          <li>Imprisonment up to 5 years for severe environmental offenses.</li>
          <li>Permanent closure of polluting industries or cancellation of operating licenses.</li>
          <li>Seizure of vehicles or machinery involved in illegal dumping or deforestation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These legal frameworks ensure accountability and promote responsible environmental behavior
          among both citizens and organizations.
