    <h2>Promoting Mental Well-being for All</h2>
    <p>
      Mental health is not merely the absence of mental illness but a state of emotional, psychological,
      and social well-being. It influences how people think, feel, and act, and determines how they handle
      stress, make decisions, and maintain relationships. Our research shows that awareness and early
      intervention can significantly reduce long-term mental health challenges.
    </p>

    <div class="tips">
      <strong>Fact:</strong> The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that one in every eight people globally
      lives with a mental disorder, yet over 70% of them do not receive proper treatment due to lack of awareness.
    </div>

        Early counseling and healthy family interactions help in building resilience.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Adults</h4>
        <p>Stress related to work, relationships, or finances often leads to anxiety or burnout.

      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Older Adults</h4>

      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Gender Perspective</h4>
        <p>Women often experience postnatal depression and hormonal mood changes, whereas men are more prone
        to stress-related disorders due to societal expectations of strength and control.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
